  "icon": "bi bi-person",
  "description": "I am a PhD candidate in Robotics at the Colorado School of Mines, with a mechanical engineering foundation and a research focus on human-centered robotic systems. My work explores dexterous manipulation, multi-modal sensing, and AI-driven control strategies, particularly for prosthetic and teleoperation hands. I enjoy bridging mechanical design with intelligent software, and aim to contribute to next-generation robotic systems that are intuitive, adaptive, and impactful. As I am finish my thesis over the summer of 2025, I am actively seeking opportunities in R&D roles that value deep technical rigor and interdisciplinary innovation."
