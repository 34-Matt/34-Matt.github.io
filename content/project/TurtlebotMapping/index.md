For our final project in Human Centered Robotics, we investigated different exploration methods for mapping an indoor environment. I performed this project with Alex Dodge, Mitchell Waibel, and Tyler Thune.

The equipment utilized for this project were a TurtleBot 2 with and Orbbec Astra camera. For mapping the Turtlebotâ€™s surroundings, we compared the Real-Time Apperance Based Mapping and GMapping algorithms. For exploration, we used the Fronteir Exploration algorithm.
