My submission for the Break Break Jam hosted by the Colorado School of Mines. The theme for the Jam is "break". In my game, "Break My Game", I explore common glitches in old games and attempt to recreate as achievements in my game. The game is a 2D platformer where the player attempts to break pots and the game itself. The game was created in Godot with my art assets created in LibreSprite.
The game won first place in the jam with a score of 166/200.
