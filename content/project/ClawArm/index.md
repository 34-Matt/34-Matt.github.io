For our final project in Mechatronics, we created a claw that would grab an object and calculate the width of it. I worked on this project with Christian Crowley and Yunsik Jung.

The criteria for this project was to create a device with at least one sensor and one actuator. It also needed to be programmable and use a custom designed pcb.
