abstract: The monitoring of a nuclear power plant is important to ensure it is operating within the conditions specified in the reactor’s licensing and safety documentation. Data collection from sensors is critical for monitoring the status of a reactor, for providing real-time feedback signals in closed-loop control, and for predicting a reactor’s future conditions. However, the challenging operational environment in a nuclear reactor core often results in high sensor uncertainties with significant amounts of noise. To overcome these environmental challenges, an uncertainty-aware data-driven model is developed to filter the noise and reduce the sensor uncertainties. The methods were tested on trials from the Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT); however, this approach can be generalized such that it can be used in different reactors with various sensors. The resulting model significantly improves the sensor output from a collection of self-powered gamma detectors tested during steady-state and pulsed operations.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
